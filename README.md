# Java Ray Tracer

This repository contains a CPU based Java raytracer to render 3d graphics. It was created in the context of the Computer Graphics Project course by prof. P. Dutr√© at KU Leuven in Spring 2015. It was the only project to receive 19/20, the top score for that year. The accompanying report is included in [English](https://github.com/AndreasVanBarel/RayTracer/blob/main/Report.pdf) and [Dutch](https://github.com/AndreasVanBarel/RayTracer/blob/main/Verslag.pdf).

## Usage

Clone the repository. The entry point `main()` is located in `src/main/Renderer.java`. In that same file, the line `int scene_id = 22;` determines which scene will be rendered. The properties of the scene (the objects and light sources etc) for each `scene_id` can be found and modified in `src/scene/SceneGenerator.java`. The properties of the camera (such as depth of field parameters) can be found and modified in `src/CameraGenerator.java`. Anti-aliasing is implemented as doing `AA` random samples in each pixel, where `AA` can be set in `src/main/Renderer.java` with `public static final int AA = 10;`.

## Features

Please consult the above mentioned report for a detailed description of features and accompanying rendered figures. A quick overview:

- Analytic shapes: spheres, boxes, cylinders, planes, and triangles
- Loading triangle meshes from .obj files with normal maps and uv maps
- Generation of a bounding volume hierarchy to speed up the ray tracing 
- Materials system, with support for several BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) models
- Materials can be textured, reflective, refractive, or glossy
- Environment maps (both per object or for the entire scene)
- Multiple light sources in a single scene
- Several light source types: directional light sources, point light sources, and area light sources
- Anti-aliasing (AA)
- Depth of field (DOF)
